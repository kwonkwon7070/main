    <div class="biohead"> Light Of the Origin – Meeting Myself Innate.</div>
    <p>Kwon Kanglin is an aritist who depicts the light. He studies the light exists in inner side of human and paint it on the canvas. The perspective of seeing the light inside of human who lives in real world seems similar to the concept of chakra in yoga and meditation. The way of portraying the light seems similar to the ‘mandala’ in Buddhism. However, he rather expresses light in the way of he’s own than the abstract way of depicting the light which prevailed before.</p>
    <p>The depiction of the light used to be a sacred object far from the reality. But he focuses on the light staying within human being who lives in the reality. By having the faith and belief that the light exists in the origin of human, he is on his journey to finding the origin of all things. By manifesting ‘the light inside of us’ and ‘the origin of light’ in the level of the real world and the ideal world, he also suggests the light which exists in human being as the channel which connects two worlds at the same time.</p>
    <p>The reason he is paint the light comes from the old curiosity from his youth. He was born and raised in a house located in the middle of a pastureland surrounded by hills and mountains where trees and grass spread out all over, in Gimcheon, North Geyongsang Province, South Korea (Rep. of). Zephyr full of scent of grass pleasantly greeted him every time he stepped out of a front door. Green fields stretched far over the hills, over the horizon bore him curiosity about the world. A canopy of stars blinging every night has colored ground by the color no one, but only the stars knew. This, the oldest starlight in his memory, bore him, young teenager boy a huge curiosity about not only the world, but also about the origin where the light was coming from.</p>
    <p>One day, during the winter when he just got into middle school, whole world was covered in snow. He stood still on the rooftop and watched the fields. It was the moment he was appealed to paint this white world with the light he wondered about all the time. From then, he started to learn and practice painting. Every second of painting was the happiest moment of his life, due to the feeling that he could get by painting, the feeling of getting closer to the answer to the most fascinating question for him, “Where is the origin of that light?”.</p>
    <p>Nevertheless, merely pursuing the answer to the question couldn’t afford him bread and butter. After graduating college, he hit by the wall of reality. He had to get a job and work for living. By seldom painting for a few years, curiosity inside of him just grew up bigger and bigger. At last, he couldn’t bear it, and went on a journey to find the answer. He cut off working for living and tried to see and experience as much he can while recalling the oldest light in his mind while looking for the answer. During this journey, a study resonated with his mind. The study was of the “soul and spirituality”. Starting from the origin of human, he found relation with the origin of the world and matters. Through meditation and introspection, he could find a clue to his curiosity. To search and know better of the soul, he went on a travel—which was more like a pilgrimage—to India.</p>
    <p>What he had found at India was ‘not’ something sacred, hidden behind some mysterious veil, far outside from himself. It was, instead, the light inside of himself, the light of a soul. The “origin of light” he’s been searching for at outside world was rather, on the inside of the “nature and origin of human being”. Returning from India, he’s got job again, and worked for living, but something was different. He was sure about where to go, and what to pursuit. He finally figured out that he should now investigate inscape to get the answer of the origin, the origin of the world going around.</p>
    <p>After all he’s been through, on a not-so-special normal day, the same feeling, and emotion he had on the rooftop on the snowy day when he was young suddenly came up and engulfed him totally. He realized that “The moment of painting led me to feel most close to the answer. Then it must be the painting that can only guide me to the answer and the origin.” From this moment, he looked inside of himself by meditation constantly, and in detail. Every time he reached the inside of himself, there was the light he’d been together since he was young back in the home over the hills always. Until now, he deems there is a warm and comforting light inside of human being, and the origin of the world. Thus, he is painting the light emerging from the origin of all on a canvas.</p>

    <div class="biohead2"> note.</div>
    <p>I’m painting and trying to depict pieces with the thinking that the thing innates in essence of human is the light. Meanwhile, I’m focusing on expressing the light -which exists within our origin- as the ideas and properties that we can easily encounter in daily life, not as the abstract concept. By portraying the light as above, I’m intending to make people who’s appreciating my arts feel comfortable, sympathize with the warmth and the originality of the light, and look in their inner side. Thus, I draw the light as the simplest and meanwhile the most comprehensive form, the circular form of light. Through this way of depicting, I express the simplicity of the light while expressing the property of light which can endlessly spread out to the eternity from the origin at the same time.</p>
    <p>Two fundamental topics which composes my works are ‘the study of human being’ and ‘the search of the light exists in the origin’. The memory from my youth that strongly stuck in my mind, the curiosity of the color of light from the memory drove me go on a journey in search of the origin of the light. During the journey, I came across the way of drawing the light, and the origin of all things, ‘mandala’. By learning mandala, the thought that contemplation of the light should be companied by the study of human being and the essence of human came up. As we all are human being living in reality after all, fundamental consideration of human itself is necessity.</p>
    <p>Likewise, the study and search of one, innate of human or essence of the light arouses the curiosity and interest about the other one. Therefore, I’m contemplating and dealing with painting the coexistence of two world, the real world we are thrown, and the ideal world which the origin of all things after and before the form of material.</p>
    <p>The light I mentioned above, which placed in inner side of human being holds the same properties the light as the essence of the ideal world I deem. Accordingly, I’m depicting the light as the origin of the ideal world and as a channel which connects the real world and the ideal world.</p>
    <p>The real world and the ideal world, spoke again, can be manifested in a level of a human body and the soul innate. By connecting to pole, Inner side and outer side, body and soul, reality and spirituality, we human can reach the reason and origin of all things, and finally can fulfill the existential vacuum.</p>
    <p>At the moment, I’m continuously searching the strong bond and connection of the two subjects exploring the origin which not separated from the real existence. Having the faith and belief of existence of the light in human being, I’m keeping on this works. Nevertheless, I’m focusing on contemplating ‘the thoughts of the light and the origin’ on the basis of ‘the human existence living in reality’ not to make the message float around the sky of excessive metaphysics. </p>
