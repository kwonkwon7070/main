    <div class="biohead"> Soul, painted by light.</div>
    <p>Neumjae Kwon Kanglin, he was born and raised in a house located in the middle of a pastureland surrounded by hills and mountains where trees and grass spread out all over, in Gimcheon, North Geyongsang Province, South Korea (Rep. of). Zephyr full of scent of grass pleasantly greeted him every time he stepped out of a front door. Green fields stretched far over the hills, over the horizon bore him curiosity about the world. A canopy of stars blinging every night has colored ground by the color no one, but only the stars knew. This, the oldest starlight in his memory, bore him, young teenager boy a huge curiosity about not only the world, but also about the origin where the light was coming from.</p>
    <p>One day, during the winter when he just got into middle school, whole world was covered in snow. He stood still on the rooftop and watched the fields. It was the moment he was appealed to paint this white world with the light he wondered about all the time. From then, he started to learn and practice painting. Every second of painting was the happiest moment of his life, due to the feeling that he could get by painting, the feeling of getting closer to the answer to the most fascinating question for him, “Where is the origin of that light?”.</p>
    <p>Nevertheless, merely pursuing the answer to the question couldn’t afford him bread and butter. After graduating college, he hit by the wall of reality. He had to get a job and work for living. By seldom painting for a few years, curiosity inside of him just grew up bigger and bigger. At last, he couldn’t bear it, and went on a journey to find the answer. He cut off working for living and tried to see and experience as much he can while recalling the oldest light in his mind while looking for the answer. During this journey, a study resonated with his mind. The study was of the “soul and spirituality”. Starting from the origin of human, he found relation with the origin of the world and matters. Through meditation and introspection, he could find a clue to his curiosity. To search and know better of the soul, he went on a travel—which was more like a pilgrimage—to India.</p>

    <p>What he had found at India was ‘not’ something sacred, hidden behind some mysterious veil, far outside from himself. It was, instead, the light inside of himself, the light of a soul. The “origin of light” he’s been searching for at outside world was rather, on the inside of the “nature and origin of human being”. Returning from India, he’s got job again, and worked for living, but something was different. He was sure about where to go, and what to pursuit. He finally figured out that he should now investigate inscape to get the answer of the origin, the origin of the world going around.</p>

    <p>After all this he’s been through, on a not-so-special normal day, the same feeling, and emotion he had on the rooftop on the snowy day when he was young suddenly came up and engulfed him totally. He realized that “The moment of painting led me to feel most close to the answer. Then it must be the painting that can only guide me to the answer and the origin.” From this moment, he looked inside of himself by meditation constantly, and in detail. Every time he reached the inside of himself, there was the light he’d been together since he was young back in the home over the hills always. Until now, he deems there is a warm and comforting light inside of human being, and the origin of the world. Thus, he is painting the light emerging from the origin of all on a canvas.</p>

    <div class="biohead2"> note.</div>
    <p>I try to depict coexistence of two world, reality world where all the lives are originated from, and the spiritual world where everything before the matters are rooted from. I think the light of spiritual world stay within the inside of human. Thus, I’m portraying light as a channel between the two worlds, and as the origin itself also. The two worlds, spoken again, can be described as a level of human body and soul. ‘Inside and outside of body’, ‘body and soul’, ‘reality and spirituality’, by connecting both ends, we can get to the origin and truth we’ve been yearning for and fill our existential anxiety.</p>
